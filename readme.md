## How to build
To build this program simply use the make file and type make into the console.

## What to have to run
To run this program, have a file that you wish to compress (preferably .txt so you can see the conversion).

## What running it will do
Then enter the name of that file into the program when you run it (the program will prompt you, also make sure the
file is in the same folder as the program). Then the program will output the compression rate and the code for each
letter. After that, you can either write the compression to a file that will automatically be named "compression.txt", 
or you can choose to output the compression to the console (but this is only for files of less than 1000 characters),
since too many characters will cause the console to freeze up and crash.
